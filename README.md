# AndroidContagionTracker

This is a demo of a Contagion Tracker. It will map checkins at 4 or 5 locations in Horn Lake, MS. The checkIns can then be manipulated and mapped into contagion exposures via the website https://www.ordinaryGeeks.com/CME.

ToDO:
Pull Places from Google Api for checkins nearby
