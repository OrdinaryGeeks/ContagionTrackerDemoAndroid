# AndroidContagionTracker


This is the framework for a android xamarin forms app that allows people to drive up and down Goodman Road, Horn Lake, MS to checkin to places from Google Places API and check in to track contagions via a database that routinely updates checker.  The website no longer is active however.
<s>This is a demo of a Contagion Tracker. It will map checkins at 4 or 5 locations in Horn Lake, MS. The checkIns can then be manipulated and mapped into contagion exposures via the website https://www.ordinaryGeeks.com/CME.

ToDO:
Pull Places from Google Api for checkins nearby
