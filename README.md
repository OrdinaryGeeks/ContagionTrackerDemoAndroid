# ContagionTrackerDemoAndroid
This is a demo of a Contagion Tracker. It will map checkins at 4 or 5 locations in Horn Lake, MS. The checkIns can then be manipulated and mapped into contagion exposures via the website https://www.ordinaryGeeks.com/CMEDemo/CME.  The bootstrapper/bindable property/ forms and native code that sets up the Points and the map comes from the book Xamarin Forms Projects by Johann Karlsson and Daniel Hindrikes.
